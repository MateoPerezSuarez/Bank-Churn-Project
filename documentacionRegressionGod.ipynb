By choosing different quantiles, you can predict the median or any other quantile instead of just the mean. As we have been having issues with outliers in the previous models, we expect this model to perform, not good, but at least better than the rest. For that, we are using the QuantileRegressor library and Optuna for optimizing its hyperparameters, we will make 30 trials:\n",
