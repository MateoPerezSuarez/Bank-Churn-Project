Raw Dataset:







Cleaned Dataset:


    Explanation:
        As some of the columns are categorical variables, we have decided to factorize them and transform
        them into dummy variables as it is the proper way to use them for training our models in the future.

        For example Geography column we have decided to convert it to dummy, because at the analysis stage,
        we found that our dataset only had information from 3 countries, so setting a number to each of them
        is a good way to prevent issues in our model training stages.

        Same happends with Card Type column which only has 3 card categories.

    Solution:
        The columns that have been changed are: Gender, Geography and Card Type.

        Gender: Female = 0, Male = 1
        Geography: France = 0, Spain = 1, Germany = 2
        Card Type: Diamond = 0, Gold = 1, ....= 2


Normalized Dataset:
    Explanation:
        We decided to create a normalized dataset, in case we decided to use the hole dataset for training a model
